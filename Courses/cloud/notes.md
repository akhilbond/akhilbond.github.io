# This course is a Pluralsight course taught by David Chappell.

## Categorizing Cloud Computing
- Cloud Applications
  - Commonly know as SaaS(Software as a Service) provided by some service provider.
- Cloud Platforms
  - Technologies for running applications, storing data, and more.
- Private Clouds
 - Cloud platform technologies in on-premise data centers.

## Cloud Applications: Software as a Service

- Applications are Multi-Tenancy
  - Multi-Tenancy means that an application is shared.

- Benefits for Users
  - Faster deployment - no local installation
  - Usage-based pricing - you only pay for what you use
  - Less financial risk - lower up-front costs and free trials
  - Reduced need for on-premises resources - servers and IT staff can be reduced
  - Easier upgrades - no on-premises software to update
- Risks for Users
  - Requires trusting SaaS provider - for availability and security
  - Raises legal/regulatory concerns - requires storing data outside customer premises
  - Limits customization - if customers share a multi-tenant-application
  - Harder to integrate - with on-premises applications
  - Lower performance - than on-premises applications

- Benefits for Vendors
  - Provides a more predictable revenue stream - compared to traditional licensing
  - Can sell directly to business decision makers - without the need to go through IT
  - Lowered support costs - due to shared multi-tenant applications
  - Provides more knowledge - about how customers use the application
  - Offers potential to reach new customers - in broader markets

- Risks for Vendors
  - Must demonstrate real value up front - due to the try-before-you-buy options
  - Revenue comes more slowly - because of typical SaaS pricing model
  - May lessen the ability to sell customization - due to multi-tenant applications
  - Can bring new sales challenges - customer resistance to the cloud
  - Requires significant business changes - pricing and sales

## Cloud Platforms

- What cloud platforms offer over traditional hosting:
  - Immediate access to more services than conventional hosting
  - Usage-based pricing
  - Global scale and scalability

- Benefits
  - Faster deployment - no wait for computing resources
  - Usage-based pricing - letting you pay only for what you use
  - Less financial risk - with lower up-front costs in hardware and software
  - Reduced need for on-premise resources - such as servers and IT staff
  - Easier upgrades - with no on-premises software to update

- Risks
  - Requires trusting a cloud platform provider - for availability and data security
  - Raises legal/regulatory concerns - with storing data outside customer premises
  - Harder to integrate - with on-premises software
  - Can have lower performance - than on-premises platforms
  - Less controls for developers - that on-premises platforms

- Technologies
  - Compute
    - Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
    - Platform as a Service(PaaS)
    - Containers as a Service(CaaS)
    - Functions as a Services(FaaS) - "Serverless" computing
  - Data
    - Database in a VM
    - Unstructured data - Object Storage
    - Managed databases
      - Relational Storage
      - NoSQL Storage
  - Other Technologies
    - Hadoop/Spark support
    - Machine Learning

## Private Clouds

- Allow companies to harness the power of the public cloud in an on-premise datacenter.
- Hybrid clouds - A cloud with a combination of public and private cloud services
- Impact of Private clouds today
  - Public clouds and private clouds work in a complimentary fashion. They both address different problems
  - Market was slow to take off - due to the complexity
  - Private clouds can provide real value - Fast access to computing resources and modern application services
