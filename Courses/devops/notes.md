## Making a DevOps Transition

- Change in culture
  - Reestablish the shared goals/objectives of the organization
    - This allows us to make sure that all groups in the organization are all working towards the shared goal and individual targets. This can relieve pain points throughout the organization.
  - Make sure that employees are empowered
    - Allow employees to sound the alarm if anything is going wrong and make sure that they are trusted and empowered to do what is right.
  - Accountability
    - Make sure that everyone at the organization is accountable. It is very difficult to have empowerment if the employees are not accountable. This also includes rewarding people who take responsibility.
  - Teamwork
    - Make sure that all the teams work together in times of quiet and crisis. This can be done with team building exercises, inter-team lunch breaks, stand up meetings, etc.
  - Learning
    - As an organization people should be learning all the time and sharing what others have learned. This includes learning new things, but also going back and reviewing things that went wrong.
  - Trust
    - Have employees trust each other, other teams, and the rest of the supply chain. Trust will allow the organization to work more efficiently and will also make sure that employees are happy.


- Change in Organization
  - Clear vision
    - Having a clear vision of where the organization wants to go, and also make sure the employees know what they are working on and the values that the projects have.
  - Bottlenecks
    - Identifying the constraints and figuring out how to get the most out of them. These bottlenecks can be technical, social, tools, people, and even outside parties.
  - Complete Teams
    - Have teams with a person that can all contribute equally to the group, and also have the ability to stay with the project even after the project is deployed. This allows the company the reduce recovery time when changes need to be made for a older project.
  - Consider handoffs
    - Consider that your team may be handing off the project to another group who is not the end user. Also at times, the end user may even be a team within the organization.
  - Self Assessment
    - Make sure that all groups review all of the interactions between them with consideration to the project. This includes how the projects are handed off between teams, change management, how projects interface, deployment management, knowledge management, etc.
  - Eliminating waste
    - Eliminate rules and/or policies that were put in place to protect the organization a long time ago and are now becoming bottlenecks.
