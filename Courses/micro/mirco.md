A summer course runs for the whole summer. The course fees are $1,300.
If you don't take the course, you could work at Job A which pays $7000 OR Job B which pays $6000. Both courses take the entire summer.

Opportunity cost of taking the course: $8,300 (course fee + highest forgone alternative) -> Took the course and forgo the Jobs money(only Job A because it is the highest and you could only choose one Job out of the two)
