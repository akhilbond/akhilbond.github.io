- An android app can be pictured as a collection of screens, unlike other desktop applications which are usually viewed as a single unit.
  - In Android, each "screen" in the collection of screens is known as an Activity

- An activity is similar to a webpage in a web browser, as a website is a collection of webpages and the Android app is a collection of screens
- The main page of a website is similar to the ```MainActivity``` in Android
- In a website, you can click on a link and are sent to another page via a different URL. In Android, you are also sent to another screen when you select a link through the ```Intent```
- On the web, links can take you to different webpages. It is the same with Android, an Activity on one app may lead you to another Activity on another app
