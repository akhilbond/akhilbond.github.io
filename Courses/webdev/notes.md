# HTML
- HTML allows us to specify the exact formatting of text over the internet just by using text and a few simple tags.

## General Rule of HTML

```HTML
<tagName> Content </tagName>
```
- The first tag(<tagName>) is an opening tag which specifies where a specific type of formatting begins
- The content that the user would like to be formatted goes in between the tags
- The second tag(</tagName>) is a closing tag, which specifies when the formatting should stop
